Make changes by putting bracket in the definition of assignment and reassignment Ex. (((a = 3)));

Make error types meaning that in the statement we will make the case when the semi colon is missing.

We did not write the hint part of the code.

The BINNOT statement is only on one operator

In the base types we did not add the undefines terminal

In the definition of arralylist we will add 
			arraydecl COMMA arraylist

Do not forget to remove the F work in the code

In the console.log statement we will need to add the statement of printlist because we do not have expression COMMA expression derivation.

We need to add the typeof statement in the expression .
		expression : TYPEOF expression

Need to implement the exponent operator.
